# AUX' GROK 4 SPECIAL PRESET
Since Grok is my favorite AI for roleplay, I couldn't pass it by when I saw how very few presets adapted specifically for it now exist, so I made my own. I must also say that the preset has shown fantastic results on Claude models (Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5), and satisfactory results on Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT 5.1 (just in case you don't use Grok). However, in my subjective opinion, a slightly different approach is needed for each of these models individually for better results. That's exactly why this preset is called 'Grok Special'.
##  What is unique about this preset?
- Improved balanced narrative system: My balanced narrative combines the computing component of AI and the reality of the human world, transforming it into a system that will never let you get bored.
- Integration of copying user's writing style: You think that your writing style better than your artificial companion's one? You want to teach it your skills? I made AI look up to you in everything, just turn the toggle on.
- Interactive fanfiction mode: You don't want to participate in RP and just wish to observe the development of events between the canonical characters? You're welcome.
- Character archetypes: It's exhausting when an AI repeatedly makes typical mistakes in portraying a character of a certain archetype (cold characters, for example), not taking into account their features and forcing them to behave in a way that is unusual for them. Now you're free of that.
- CAPTCHA ban system: If you often find banned words in AI output, the CAPTCHA system will ease your suffering.
- Humanize skills: This is a unique tool that enhances the emotional intelligence of AI within your story and takes into account all the human characteristics of your characters. Like, they're literally alive!
- Adapted for high-context RPs: Thanks to high-quality reasoning, your RP will bring you pleasure for many, many thousands of tokens to come.
## New-level Reasoning System
My reasoning block is made in the Q&A format and is based on each prompt present in the preset, which allows the AI to take into account all the instructions given to it in the narration and significantly improve the quality of the output thanks to the 'human supervisor' (Aux).
